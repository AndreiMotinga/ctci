    How to read/write from/to files
    How to read input from the console
    How to split strings
    Is string length a function or a property (answer: it doesn’t matter, but still reflects poorly on you)
    How to declare and use 2D arrays

week 2-3 Simple data structures/algorithms
  Complexity Analysis (a.k.a BigO)
  Arrays
  Stacks
  Queues
  Linked List
  Trees
  Tries (They are effectively trees, but it’s still good to call them out separately).
  Graphs (BFS and DFS)
  Hash Tables
  Heaps
  Sorting
  Searching

week 4-5  Practice simple Data Structreds/Algo challanges
  Brush up your array skills with questions like:
    Remove Even Integers from Array
    Merge Two Sorted Arrays
    First Non-Repeating Integer in an Array
    Find Second Maximum Value in an Array
    Brush up your Linked List concepts with questions like:

  Find Length of Linked List
    Search in Singly Linked List
    Reverse a Linked List
    Find Middle Value of Linked List
    Brush up your Stack/Queue skills with questions like:

  Sort values in Stack
    Create Stack where min() returns minimum value in O(1)
    Implement Two Stacks using one Array
    Practice Tree Problems like:

  Find minimum value in Binary Search Tree
    Find Height of Binary Tree
    Find kth maximum value in Binary Search Tree
    Practice Graph Problems:

  Implement Breadth First Search
    Implement Depth First Search
    Detect cycle in Graph
    Practice basic Trie Problems:

  Total number of words in Trie
    Find all words stored in Trie

  Practice basic Heap problems:
    Find k smallest elements in a list
    Find k largest elements in an array

week 6-8  Practice more challanging problems
  Implement Binary Search
  Find the Intersection point of two linked lists
  Reverse words in a sentence
  Check if two binary trees are identical
  Clone (deep copy) a directed graph
  Find solutions to a Boggle game
  Determine if there are any three integers in an array that sum equal to the given value.


week 9-10.
  How are web-servers load-balanced?
    How are databases shared?
    How are large files stored?
    How is the network set up for redundancy and maximum throughput?

  You’ll want to practice questions like:
    Design Instagram
    Design Facebook Newsfeed
    Design Uber

Week 12 — Object-Oriented Design Interviews:
  Design an ATM
  Design an elevator
  Design a Parking System
